# Parallel Filter Optimization

## Overview

This project involves optimizing an existing filter application program by integrating parallel processing. My contributions focused on enhancing the programâ€™s performance by applying multithreading techniques, including **Pthreads** and **OpenMP**.

## Contributions

- **Multithreading with Pthreads**: Added Pthreads to improve processing efficiency on multicore systems.
- **Alternative OpenMP Implementation**: Developed an OpenMP version to demonstrate proficiency in multiple threading approaches, though this version was not essential for core functionality.

## Acknowledgment

The original filter application code was provided, and my work was specifically in applying threading techniques to optimize performance. The base code for the filter itself was not developed by me.
